# Fractals
Experiments with generating escape time fractals in julia

In general escape time fractals are
generated by plotting the set of points
in the complex plane where iteration of some
function $f_c(z)$, 
$$z_{n+1} = f_c(z)$$
does not diverge to infinity.

Depending on the function $f_c$, different
fractals are generated.

Colorings can be added e.g. based on the number of
iterations is takes a point to escape
(see [histogram colouring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plotting_algorithms_for_the_Mandelbrot_set)).

Alternatively, colours can be selected from a map (such as an image) using an [orbit trap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit_trap).

### Mandelbrot set

$$f_c(z) = z^2 + c$$
iterated from $z_0 = 0$


### Julia set
If $c$ is held constant and $z$ varied,
$$f_c(z) = z^2 + c$$
the corresponding Julia set is generated.
Differing values of $c$ give different Julia sets


### Burning ship fractal
$$f_c(z) = (|Re(z)| + i|Im(z)|)^2 + c$$
iterated from $z_0 = 0$

## Buddhabrot
Probability distribution of the orbits of points that *do* escape to infinity
under iteration of the function:
$$f_c(z) = z^2 + c$$

Using different numbers of maximum iterations for each channel in 
an RGB image:

## Animations
We can animate the julia sets by varying $c$ with time, e.g. moving the point
with a lissajous curve:

Similarly, using an image for an orbit trap and using the same trajectory
of $c$:
