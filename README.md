# Fractals
Experiments with generating escape time fractals in julia

In general escape time fractals are
generated by plotting the set of points
in the complex plane where
$$z_{n+1} = f_c(z)$$
does not diverge to infinity.

Depending on the function $f_c$, different
fractals are generated.

Colorings can be added e.g. based on the number of
iterations is takes a point to escape
(see [histogram colouring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plotting_algorithms_for_the_Mandelbrot_set)).

Alternatively, colours can be selected from a map (such as an image) using an [orbit trap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit_trap).

### Julia set
$$f_c(z) = z^2 + c$$
Differing values of $c$ give different members of the
julia set.

### Mandelbrot set
$$z_{n+1} = f_c(z)$$
$$f_c(z) = z^2 + c$$
iterated from $z_0 = 0$

### Burning ship fractal
$$z_{n+1} = f_c(z)$$
$$f_c(z) = |z|^2 + c$$
iterated from $z_0 = 0$

## Buddhabrot
Probability distribution of points that *do* escape to infinity
under iteration of the function:
$$f_c(z) = z^2 + c$$

Using different numbers of max iterations for each channel in 
an RGB image:

## Animations
We can animate the julia set by varying $c$ with time, e.g. moving the point
with a lissajous curve:

Similarly, using an image for an orbit trap and using the same trajectory
of $c$:
